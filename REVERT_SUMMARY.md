# Reverted to Original State ↩️

## ✅ **Changes Made:**

### **1. Login Page Restored**
- **Removed:** Admin Panel button.
- **Removed:** Admin auto-login logic.
- **Restored:** Simple, clean User Login page.

### **2. Main App Flow Restored**
- **Removed:** Auto-routing to Admin Dashboard.
- **Restored:** All users (including admin email) now go to **Home Page** upon login.

### **3. Admin Panel Status**
- Admin Panel files are still in the project (safe), but they are **hidden** and won't interfere with the app.
- The app works exactly like it did before the Admin Panel integration.
